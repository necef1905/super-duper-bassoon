A simple token protocol for easy management of asset on Binance chain <https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP2.md>

BNB is BEP2

## What is BEP20?

A token protocol on BSC which is compatible with BEP2 and [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20). It extends ERC20 and contains more interfaces, such as `getOwner` and `decimals`.

## What is BEP8?

It is proposed to accommodate the small or micro projects, intellectual properties, and other small token economies. Similar to SME board in the traditional stock markets, BEP8 tokens markets will increase the liquidity of utility tokens of startups or Intellectual Property (IP) tokens by removing the capital requirements for listing. Besides, any BEP8 token issuer can choose to directly list against BNB and BUSD without the voting process of validators.
